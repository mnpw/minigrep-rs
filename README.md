# minigrep-rs
Minimal [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) written in Rust! Follows [chapter 10](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html) of The Rust Book.

### Usage
`cargo run <word> <file>`

## Notes
- Guideline for splitting the separate concerns (see more [here](https://youtu.be/6sNmJtoKDCo?t=1121)) of a binary program when `main` starts getting large: 
    - Split your program into a _main.rs_ and a _lib.rs_ and move your programâ€™s logic to _lib.rs_.
    - As long as your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in _main.rs_.
    - When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it from _main.rs_ and move it to _lib.rs_.
- Call to `panic!` is more appropriate for a programming problem than a usage problem.
- Test-driven development (TDD) process:
    1. Write a test that fails and run it to make sure it fails for the reason you expect.
    2. Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.
    3. Refactor the code you just added or changed and make sure the tests continue to pass.
    4. Repeat from step 1!
